# Python Bootcamp - Session 01



## What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.
Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. 


## CLI: Command Line Interface


## GUI vs CLI
GUI or Graphical User Interface is a type of interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

CLI or Command Line Interface is a text-based interface that is used to operate software and operating systems while allowing the user to respond to visual prompts by typing single commands into the interface and receiving a reply in the same way.



## Some basic commands in CLI
- ls: list files and directories
- cd: change directory
- pwd: print working directory
- mkdir: make directory
- rmdir: remove directory
- touch: create file
- rm: remove file
- cp: copy file
- mv: move file
