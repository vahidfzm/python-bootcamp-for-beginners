# Python Bootcamp Beginners - Lesson 1.1 - Getting Started


## What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python is known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation.

Python itself is written in C language. link to the repository: https://github.com/python/cpython

`high-level` means that Python abstracts away the complex details of the machine and provides a simple and easy-to-understand syntax for programming.

`interpreted` means that Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, without the need for compilation.

Thanks to libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, Python has become a popular choice for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.


## CLI: Command Line Interface


## GUI vs CLI
GUI or Graphical User Interface is a type of interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

CLI or Command Line Interface is a text-based interface that is used to operate software and operating systems while allowing the user to respond to visual prompts by typing single commands into the interface and receiving a reply in the same way.



## Some basic commands in CLI
- ls: list files and directories
- cd: change directory
- pwd: print working directory
- mkdir: make directory
- rmdir: remove directory
- touch: create file
- rm: remove file
- cp: copy file
- mv: move file

## Python REPL
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop. It is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user.


To start the Python REPL, open the terminal and type python. You will see the Python prompt >>>. 

You can type any Python code and press Enter to see the result.


## Install VS Code
VsCode is a free lightweight code editor for Windows, MacOS,  and Linux. It is a great tool for editing Python code.
It can be downloaded from the following link: https://code.visualstudio.com/
